				<b><i>Substance Abuse Prevention and Rehababilitation in ABCR Barangay</i></b>
			</p>

			<p id="new_sapar_content">
				In ABCR Barangay, Substance Abuse Prevention is done by monitoring the residents by assigned officials. According to Eleanor Dulay, the secretary of the barangay, they roam around 
				the barangay to observe the residents. Whenever they observe strange events regarding substance abuse, they immediately report it directly to Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA).<br><br>
				
				Unfortunately, ABCR Barangay has no rehabilitation centers, instead, all caught residents who are using illegal substance are sent to the nearest police station where the police station
				will take in custody of these residents.<br><br>
				
				The ABCR Barangay gives flyers regarding the abuse of these substances. These flyers contains information about the substance and its effects to the human body.
