			<p class="font2"><i>The Keys to Paradise</i></p>
				<p class="font2"> Peace and Order is undoubtedly one of the key factors on
				a barangay being considered <q>Class A</q>. There are many laws about keeping
				the people safe but some of them are not always followed. There are the police
				who are stationed in the barangay and they do patrols throughout the night but
				still, crimes happen. Now why is that? There are countless laws that are implemented and many policemen working. There are even some volunteers. The
				real problem here is there is no discipline within the people themselves.
				The law already says that all people that are under 18 years of age are not
				allowed to roam after 10 PM. But some still go out and if danger comes their
				way, there is nothing they can do. The residents and the authorized people
				should be working together to achieve this. It is hard, but it is possible.
